      <li>½ tablespoon coarsely crushed cashews</li>
      <li>4 cups tightly packed grated carrots About ½ Kg</li>
      <li>4 cups milk</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon whole pistachios</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
      <li>¾ cup sugar (adjust as per your taste)</li>
      <li>¼ cup grated khova (mawa), (optional)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon each of slivered pistachios and almonds</li>
      <li>A pinch of nutmeg (grated or powderd), (optional)</li>

    <h2>Method for Carrot Halwa Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a tablespoon ghee in a heavy bottomed pan / Kadai. Add the cashews
        and fry until golden brown. Remove them and keep aside on a blotter
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pan, add another tablespoon more ghee and saute the grated
        carrot for a minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then add the milk and the whole pistachios. Also add saffron strands, if
        you are using it. Cook until the milk evaporates and the carrots are
        softened and cooked completely. Keep stirring it to avoid the carrots
        from sticking to the bottom and burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the liquid evaporates completely (and the carrots are completely
        cooked), add the sugar, khova (if using) and stir until it melts. Taste
        and adjust the amount of sugar, if needed. Keep stirring until the
        cooked carrot mixture thickens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the remaining ghee, cardamom powder, roasted cashews and keep
        stirring until the carrot mixture thickens and comes off the pan as one
        mass. Garnish with slivered pistachios and almonds before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
