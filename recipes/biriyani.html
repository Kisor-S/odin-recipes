    <h2>What is Biriyani ?</h2>
    <p>
      Biryani (/bɜːrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish that was thought to have
      originated from Iran before settling in modern India. It is made with
      rice, some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, or fish) and
      spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by
      substituting vegetables for the meat.
